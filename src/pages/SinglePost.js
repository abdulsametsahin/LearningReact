                            Steve Holt! No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer’s questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide. I don’t criticize you! And if you’re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

He’ll want to use your yacht, and I don’t want this thing smelling like fish. We just call it a sausage. I don’t criticize you! And if you’re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

                            No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. There’s so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. No… but I’d like to be asked! Whoa, this guy’s straight?
